The goal of this project is to integrate samc with riak. In the end we 
will have 5-6 paxos systems wheren we have verified using samc. we want 
to show that samc can verify all of paxos system.

*hopefully we will find bugs from those systems
*target: NSDI 2017
*6 months to finish all the system testing
*we want to say that we can find bugs in paxos system even though paxos theory seems flawless.



TOP-DOWN and buttom-up method
-top down: read the documentation and explore the code
-bottom-up: do print x, explore the codes until you get the high level idea of it
